    <introduction>
	    	<p>
	    		Recall that one of the ways in which we understand a mathematical object is to study its relationship to other mathematical objects.
	    		In algebra, we learn about a ring by studying its relationship to other rings via functions (introduced in <xref ref="SubSec-Homomorphisms" />) and to its ideals, introduced in <xref ref="def-ideal" />.
	    	</p>
	    	
	    	<p>
	    		The notion of an ideal number was first introduced by Ernst Kummer middle of the nineteenth century.
	    		Kummer was studying the cyclotomic integers in connection to work on Fermat's Last Theorem and reciprocity laws in number theory, and discovered, to use our modern terminology, that these rings of cyclotomic integers were not UFDs.
	    		In particular, he found irreducible cyclotomic integers that were not prime.
	    		His work, which was finished by Richard Dedekind by 1871, was to define a new class of complex number, an <em>ideal number</em> for which unique factorization into prime ideal numbers held.
	    		This notion of ideal number was later elaborated on by David Hilbert and Emmy Noether into the more general version which we stated in <xref ref="def-ideal" />.
	    	</p>
	    	
	    	<p>
	    		In this section, we explore ways of describing non-principal ideals.
	    		We also explore properties of ideals, as well as their connections to other fields of mathematics.
	    	</p>



    </introduction>
    
    <p>
    		We first explore the behavior of ideals under the usual set-theoretic operations of intersection and union.

          Let <m>R</m> be a ring and let

          Then <m>I = \bigcap\limits_{\alpha\in \Gamma} I_\alpha</m> is an ideal.

      <proof>
		  <p>
			It is clear that <m>0\in I</m>.
			Moreover, if <m>x,y\in I</m>,

    <p>
      When we studied principal ideals, we were able to describe the principal ideal in terms of a single generating element.
      However, not every ideal is principal (see the <xref ref="challenge-nonprincideal">Challenge</xref>).
      Still, we would like a way to more precisely describe the elements of such ideals; we begin with <xref ref="def_idealgeneration" />.
    </p>
    <definition xml:id="def_idealgeneration">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>R</m> be a commutative ring with identity,
          and let <m>S\subseteq R</m> be a subset.
          Then
          <men xml:id="eq_idealgeneratedbyset">
            \langle S \rangle := \bigcap\limits_{\substack{J\supseteq S\\\text{ \(J\) is an ideal } } } J
          </men>
          is called the <term>ideal generated by <m>S</m></term><idx>ideal generated by a set</idx>, and we call <m>S</m> the <term>generating set for the ideal</term>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
    	A consequence of <xref ref="def_idealgeneration" /> is the following theorem.
    </p>
	<theorem>
		<statement>
			Let <m>R</m> be a ring.
			Then <m>\ideal{\emptyset} = \set{0}</m>.
		</statement>
		<proof>
		<p>	
			Observe that for all ideals <m>J</m> in <m>R</m>, <m>\emptyset\subseteq J</m>.
			In particular, one of the ideals in the right-hand side of <xref ref="eq_idealgeneratedbyset" /> is the zero ideal.
			Since the zero ideal is a subset of all ideals, the theorem follows.

	</proof>
	</theorem>
	


    <p>
     	One way to interpret <xref ref="def_idealgeneration" /> is that <m>\ideal{S}</m> is the smallest ideal (with respect to subset inclusion) that contains <m>S</m>.
    </p>
    <theorem xml:id="theorem-smallestideal">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Given a commutative ring <m>R</m> and a subset <m>S</m> of <m>R</m>,
          <m>\ideal{S}</m> is the smallest ideal containing <m>S</m> in the sense that, if <m>J</m> is any ideal of <m>R</m> containing <m>S</m>, <m>\ideal{S}\subseteq J</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <proof>
      <p>
        Let <m>I</m> be any ideal containing <m>S</m>.
        Thus, <m>I</m> is one of the ideals on the right-hand side of <xref ref="eq_idealgeneratedbyset" />.
        Since <m>\ideal{S}</m> is formed by the intersection of <m>I</m> with other ideals,
        <m>\ideal{S}\subseteq I</m>.
      </p>
   	 </proof>
    </theorem>
    
    <p>
    		The concept elucidated by <xref ref="theorem-smallestideal" /> is helpful, but does not give us a handle on the structure of the elements of <m>\ideal{S}</m>.
     	Such a description is provided by <xref ref="thm_idealgeneratingset" />.

      </hint>
 -->
    	<proof>

      <p>
        It is clear that <m>0\in I</m>,
        and that if <m>r\in R</m> and <m>x\in I</m>, <m>rx\in I</m>.
        Moreover, the sum of two <m>R</m>-linear combinations of elements of <m>S</m> is yet another <m>R</m>-linear combination of elements of <m>S</m>.
        Thus, <m>I</m> is an ideal.
        Further, if <m>s\in S</m>,
        <m>1\cdot s \in I</m>, so <m>S\subseteq I</m>.
        Therefore, <m>\ideal{S}\subseteq I</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now assume that <m>x\in I</m>.
        Then <m>x</m> has the form <m>x = r_1 s_1 + \cdots + r_n s_n</m>.
        Each <m>s_i \in S</m>, so each
        <m>r_i s_i \in J</m> if <m>J</m> is any ideal containing <m>S</m>.
        In particular, <m>r_i s_i \in \ideal{S}</m>,
        and thus the sum <m>x = \sum r_i s_i \in \ideal{S}</m>.
      </p>
    </proof>
    </theorem>
    
   <p>
   	In other words, the ideal <m>\ideal{S}</m> contains all possible finite sums of products of ring elements with elements from <m>S</m>.

        the ideal <m>I</m> generated by <m>R</m> is denoted by <m>I = \ideal{s_1, s_2, \ldots,

    		<statement>
    			<p>
    				The ring <m>\Z[x]</m> is not a PID.

			  <p>
				Consider the ideal <m>I = \langle 2, x \rangle</m>.
			  </p>
			</hint>
    		</statement>
		<proof>
		  <p>
			Suppose that <m>I = \ideal{a(x)}</m>.
			Since <m>2\in I</m>,
			<m>2 = c(x) a(x)</m> for some <m>c(x)\in \Z[x]</m>,
			so <m>\deg c(x) = \deg a(x) = 0</m>,
			and thus <m>a(x) = a\in \Z</m>.
			We also have <m>x\in I</m>, so <m>x = b(x) a</m>,
			which implies that <m>\deg b(x) = 1</m>,
			so <m>b(x) = b_1 x + b_0</m> for some <m>b_1,b_0\in \Z</m>.
			Then <m>x = (b_1 x + b_0)a</m> implies <m>b_1 a = 1</m>.

			In either case,
			<m>a</m> is a unit in <m>\Z[x]</m> so <m>1\in I</m>.

			there are polynomials <m>p(x),q(x)\in\Z[x]</m> such that <m>1 = 2p(x) + xq(x)</m>.
			If <m>p_0</m> is the constant term of <m>p(x)</m>,
			it follows that the constant term of <m>2p(x) + xq(x)</m> is
			<m>2p_0 = 1</m>, which is a contradiction.

			Thus, <m>I</m> is not principal.

    		Note that the set <m>S</m> in <xref ref="thm_idealgeneratingset" /> need not be finite. 
    		However, in many familiar rings, every ideal will have a finite generating set, as the next theorem demonstrates.

    <theorem>
    		<statement>
    			<p>
    				Let <m>R</m> be a ring.
    				If <m>R</m> is Noetherian<fn>Recall <xref ref="def-noetherian" />.</fn>, then every ideal <m>I</m> of <m>R</m> is finitely generated.

    					Consider an arbitrary ideal <m>I</m> and inductively build an ascending chain of finitely generated ideals contained in <m>I</m>.
    				</p>
    			</hint>
    		</statement>
		<proof>
			<p>
				Assume that <m>R</m> is Noetherian.
				Inductively build an ascending chain of ideals as follows:
				<ul>
					<li>Let <m>x_1 \in I</m> be arbitrary.</li>
					<li>For all <m>i\ge 2</m>, let <m>x_i \in I\setminus \ideal{x_1, \ldots, x_{i-1}}</m> be arbitrary.</li>

				We thus obtain an ascending chain of ideals
				<me>
					\ideal{x_1} \subseteq \ideal{x_1, x_2}\subseteq \ideal{x_1,x_2,x_3}\subseteq \cdots

				which must stabilize at <m>\ideal{x_1, x_2,\ldots, x_n}</m>.
				That is, at some point, <m>I\setminus \ideal{x_1, x_2,\ldots, x_n} = \emptyset</m>, and since <m>\ideal{x_1, x_2,\ldots, x_n}\subseteq I</m>, we have <m>I = \ideal{x_1, x_2,\ldots, x_n}</m>.

    </theorem>
    
    <p>
    		In fact, we could have used the finite generation of ideals as the definition of Noetherian rings, as the two notions are equivalent.
    		First, a lemma.
    </p>
    
    <lemma xml:id="lemma-ascendingchainideal">

    <theorem>
    		<statement>
    			<p>
    				Let <m>R</m> be a ring such that every ideal of <m>R</m> is finitely generated.
    				Then <m>R</m> is Noetherian.
    			</p>
		</statement>
		<hint>
			<p>
				Argue that the ideal <m>I</m> defined in <xref ref="lemma-ascendingchainideal" /> is a finitely generated ideal of <m>R</m>, and use this to conclude that the ascending chain stabilizes.
			</p>
		</hint>
		<proof>
			<p>
				Following the hint and <xref ref="lemma-ascendingchainideal" />, we have <m>I = \ideal{x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n}</m> while <m>I_j\subseteq I</m> for all <m>j</m>.
				Since <m>I = \bigcup\limits_{j=1}^\infty I_j</m>, for each <m>k, 1\le k \le n</m>, there is a <m>j_k</m> satisfying <m>x_k \in I_{j_k}</m>.
				What is more, we may rename <m>x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n</m> so that <m>j_1 \le j_2 \le \ldots \le j_n</m> and thus
				<me>
					I_{j_1} \subseteq I_{j_2}\subseteq \cdots \subseteq I_{j_n}.
				</me>
				Observe that this means that <m>x_{j_k}\in I_{j_n}</m> for all <m>k</m>, so that <m>I = I_{j_n}</m>.
				Thus, the chain stabilizes, and <m>R</m> is Noetherian.

    		We close with a discussion of a class of ideals which are the object of active mathematical research.

          Let <m>R</m> be a ring and <m>I</m> an ideal of <m>R</m>.
          Then congruence modulo <m>I</m> is an equivalence relation on <m>R</m>.

    <p>
      The set of equivalence classes under this relation is denoted <m>R/I</m>.

    <proof>
      <p>
        Since <m>0\in I</m>, <m>a-a \in I</m> for all <m>a</m>,

        Moreover, if <m>b-a \in I</m>,

      It is a fact that any ring <m>R</m> with <m>0_R\ne 1_R</m> has a maximal ideal.
      This follows from <em>Zorn's Lemma</em>;
      a rigorous exploration of Zorn's Lemma lies outside of the scope of these notes,
      but suffice it to say that Zorn's Lemma is incredibly useful in all areas of algebra for proving existence theorems.
      For example,
      a proof that every vector space has a basis relies on Zorn's Lemma.
    </p>

      Rings with only one maximal ideal are said to be <em>local rings</em>,

      (the study of commutative rings and their properties).

          Let <m>R</m> be commutative with identity and <m>I</m> an ideal of <m>R</m>.
          Then <m>I</m> is prime if and only if <m>R/I</m> is an integral domain.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </theorem>
    <proof>
      <p>
        Begin by assuming that <m>I</m> is prime,
        and suppose <m>(a+I)(b+I) = 0+I = I</m>.
        Then <m>ab \in I</m>, and since <m>I</m> is prime,
        either <m>a\in I</m> or <m>b\in I</m>.
        Thus either <m>a+I = 0+I</m> or <m>b+I = 0+I</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now assume that <m>R/I</m> is a domain.
        Further, let <m>a,b\in R</m> be such that <m>(a+I)(b+I) = ab+I = 0+I</m>.
        Then <m>ab\in I</m>, and since <m>R/I</m> is a domain,
        <m>a+I = 0+I</m> or <m>b+I = 0+I</m>,
        i.e., <m>a\in I</m> or <m>b\in I</m>.
        Thus, <m>I</m> is prime.

    </theorem>
    <proof>
      <p>
        If <m>R/I</m> is a field,
        assume <m>J</m> is an ideal of <m>R</m> that properly contains <m>I</m>.
        Let <m>x\in J\setminus I</m>;
        then <m>x+I</m> is a nonzero element of <m>R/I</m>,
        and since <m>R/I</m> is a field,
        there is some <m>y+I</m> such that <m>(xy)+I = 1+I</m>.
        Since <m>x\in J</m>, <m>xy\in J</m>.
        As <m>1+I = (x+I)(y+I) = xy+I</m>,
        we have <m>1-xy\in I\subsetneq J</m>,
        and thus <m>1 = (1-xy)+xy \in J</m>, which means <m>J = R</m>.
        Thus, <m>I</m> is maximal.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now, suppose that <m>I</m> is maximal and let <m>x\in R\setminus I</m>.
        Apply the previous lemma to obtain
        <m>1 = xr' + y'</m>, where <m>y'\in I</m>.
        Then
        <me>
          1 + I = xs+y + I = xs + I = (x+I)(y+I)

    </theorem>
    <proof>
      <p>
        All fields are integral domains.
        Thus, if <m>I</m> is maximal,
        <m>R/I</m> is a field, thus a domain,
        and thus <m>I</m> is prime.

          In a principal ideal domain, every prime ideal is maximal.

    </theorem>
    <proof>
      <p>
        Let <m>R</m> be a PID and <m>\ideal{p}</m> a prime ideal.
        By previous work, <m>p</m> is prime.
        Suppose that <m>\ideal{p} \subseteq \ideal{m}</m>.
        Thus, <m>p\in \ideal{m}</m>, so <m>m|p</m>.
        That is, <m>p = mk</m>.
        Since <m>p</m> is prime and <m>R</m> is a domain, it is irreducible.
        Thus, either <m>m</m> or <m>k</m> is a unit.
        If <m>m</m> is a unit, then <m>\ideal{m} = R</m>.
        If <m>k</m> is a unit, then <m>m = k^{-1} p</m>,
        and thus <m>m\in \ideal{p}</m>,
        which means that <m>\ideal{m} = \ideal{p}</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thus, <m>\ideal{p}</m> is maximal.

    <theorem>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Given a ring homomorphism <m>\p : R\to S</m>,
          <m>\ker\p</m> is an ideal.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </theorem>
    <proof>
      <p>
        If <m>x,y\in \ker\p</m>, <m>\p(x+y) = \p(x) + \p(y) = 0_S + 0_S = 0_S</m>.
        Similarly, if <m>x\in \ker \p</m> and <m>r\in R</m>,
        <m>\p(rx) = \p(r) \p(x) = \p(r) 0_S = 0_S</m>.
      </p>
    </proof>
    <theorem>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>\p : R\to S</m> be a homomorphism.
          Then <m>\p</m> is one-to-one if and only if <m>\ker\p = \set{0}</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </theorem>
    <p>
      In what follows,
      we work toward a proof of the First Isomorphism Theorem for Rings.
    </p>
    <p>
      Throughout, let <m>R</m> and <m>S</m> be commutative rings with identity,
      and let <m>\p : R\to S</m> be a homomorphism.
      Recall that <m>\im \p = \setof{s\in S}{\p(r) = s\text{ for some } r\in R}</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Define <m>f: R/\ker \p \to \im \p</m> by <m>f(r+\ker \p) = \p(r)</m>.
    </p>
    <lemma>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Using the notation from above,
          <m>f</m> is a well-defined function.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </lemma>
    <proof>
      <p>
        Suppose that <m>r_1 + \ker\p = r_2 + \ker\p</m>.
        Then <m>r_2-r_1 \in \ker\p</m>,
        so <m>\p(r_2-r_1) = 0_S</m>, and thus <m>\p(r_1) = \p(r_2)</m>.
        Therefore, <m>f(r_1+\ker\p) = f(r_2+\ker\p)</m>,
        and <m>f</m> is well-defined.
      </p>
    </proof>
    <lemma>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Using the notation above, <m>f</m> is a homomorphism.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </lemma>
    <proof>
      <p>
        We show that <m>f</m> preserves addition.
        That it preserves multiplication will follow similarly.
        Observe that <m>f((x+\ker\p) + (y+\ker\p)) = f((x+y)+\ker\p) = \p(x+y) = \p(x)+\p(y) = f(x+\ker\p) + f(y+\ker\p)</m>.
      </p>
    </proof>
    <lemma>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Using the notation above, <m>f</m> is one-to-one.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </lemma>
    <proof>
      <p>
        Suppose that <m>f(r_1 + \ker\p) = f(r_2 + \ker\p)</m>.
        That is, <m>\p(r_1) = \p(r_2)</m>.
        Then <m>\p(r_1 - r_2) = 0_S</m>,
        so <m>r_1 -r_2 \in \ker\p</m>,
        and therefore <m>r_1 + \ker\p = r_2 + \ker \p</m>.
        Thus, <m>f</m> is one-to-one.
      </p>
    </proof>
    <lemma>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Using the notation above, <m>f</m> is onto.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </lemma>
    <proof>
      <p>
        Since <m>\p</m> is onto <m>\im \p</m> by definition,
        given any <m>s\in \im \p</m> there is some <m>r\in R</m> such that <m>\p(r) = s</m>.
        Then <m>f(r+\ker\p) = \p(r)</m>.
      </p>
    </proof>
    <p>
      We thus obtain:

    <theorem>
      <title>(First Isomorphism Theorem)</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>\p : R\to S</m> be a homomorphism of commutative rings.
          Then <m>R/\ker \p \cong \im \p</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          In particular,
          if <m>\p : R\to S</m> is onto, <m>R/\ker \p \cong S</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </theorem>
    <theorem>
      <statement>
        <p>
          We have the following isomorphisms of rings.
          <ol>
            <li>
              <p>
                <m>\Z/\ideal{m} \cong \Z_m</m>
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                <m>\Q[x]/\ideal{x-5} \cong \Q</m>
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                <m>\R[x]/\ideal{x^2+1} \cong \C</m>
              </p>
            </li>
          </ol>
        </p>
      </statement>
    </theorem>
    <proof>
      <p>
        Define <m>\p: \R[x] \to \C</m> by <m>\p(p(x)) = p(i)</m>.
        We saw earlier that this evaluation map is a homomorphism.
        It is easy to see that <m>\p</m> is onto as
        <m>\p(a+bx) = a+bi</m> for any <m>a,b\in \R</m>.
        Thus, <m>\R[x]/\ker\p \cong \C</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        We claim that <m>\ker\p = \ideal{x^2+1}</m>.
        Clearly, <m>\ideal{x^2+1} \subseteq \ker\p</m>.
        Moreover, <m>\ker\p \subsetneq \R[x]</m>.
        Finally, <m>\ideal{x^2+1}</m> is prime and thus maximal,
        as <m>\R[x]</m> is a PID. Thus,
        <m>\ker\p = \ideal{x^2+1}</m>.
      </p>
