<p>One of the ways to better understand mathematical structures is to understand their similar substructures (e.g., subspaces of vector spaces in linear algebra). Again, this is a formalization of an idea that you have been using since you were a child. There are certain properties of the rational numbers that you understand because you understand the real numbers - this is because the rational numbers are a subring of the real numbers.</p>
