<p>We likely have an intuitive idea of what is meant by \(\R\text{,}\) the set of real numbers. Defining \(\R\) rigorously is actually quite difficult, and will occupy a significant amount of time in a first course in real analysis. Thus, we will make use of your intuition. It is certainly the case that \(\N\subseteq \Z\subseteq \Q\subseteq \R\text{,}\) but \(\R\) also contains many irrational numbers, such as \(\pi\text{,}\) \(e\text{,}\) \(\sqrt{2}\text{,}\) and so on.</p>
