<p>In this section, we begin to explore some of the arithmetic and algebraic properties of \(\Z\text{.}\) One of the primary goals of this sections is to formalize definitions that you've been using and have an intuitive understanding of. At first glance, this might seem to add an unnecessary layer of complication. However, it will be abundantly clear as we move forward that a formalized mathematical language and notation are necessary to extend these properties to a more abstract setting. We begin with a twist on a familiar notion.</p>
